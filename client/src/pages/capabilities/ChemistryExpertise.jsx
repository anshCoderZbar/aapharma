                          Biosynthesis of triterpenoids in cells involves a
                          handful of enzymes and can be divided into four
                          stages. The formation of geranyl diphosphate from

                          diphosphate which is then converted to squalene and
                          epoxysqualene. In the last stage, epoxysqualene is
                          cyclized to the triterpenoid. This complicated pathway
